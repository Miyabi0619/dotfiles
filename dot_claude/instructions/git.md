# Git Guidelines

## General Principles

- Always use MCP Server tools when available
- Fallback to CLI only when MCP doesn't support the operation
- Never force push without explicit user confirmation
- Always verify branch name before operations

## Branching Strategy

- main: Production-ready code
- develop: Integration branch
- feature/*: New features
- fix/*: Bug fixes

## Commit Standards

- Follow Conventional Commits format
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write clear, descriptive messages in Japanese
